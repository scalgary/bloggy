        "I discovered ‚ÄúAn Introduction to Statistical Learning‚Äù (ISLR) a few years ago, and since then, it‚Äôs become my go-to reference for machine learning. A real classic!\n",
        "\n",
        "Lately, I‚Äôve been itching to dive deeper into the new edition‚Äîespecially with the updated chapters, Python labs, and all the fresh content.\n",
        "\n",
        "Between the book itself, the video lectures available on edX (and other platforms), and the **awesome** book club run by the DSLC community, I‚Äôve really immersed myself in this world.\n",
        "\n",
        "It‚Äôs been the perfect opportunity to revisit the fundamentals with a fresh, more relaxed mindset. Learning just for the joy of it‚Äîrather than to pass a test‚Äîis a totally different experience. And honestly, it‚Äôs so much more satisfying.\n",
        "\n",
        "To keep a record of this deep dive, I decided to start a blog. The good news? It‚Äôs incredibly easy to set up with Quarto, and hosting it on GitHub is a breeze.\n",
        "\n",
        "I‚Äôm not trying to summarize the book or highlight the key concepts. That‚Äôs not the goal. I just want to take the time to explore the parts that speak to me‚Äîto reflect, to play, to understand better. Kind of like a personal study journal, but online.\n",
