Since this post doesn't specify an explicit `image`, the first image in the post will be used in the listing page of posts.


## How to add a new post

It is very easy.

- Create a sub-directory within posts and add an index.qmd file in this directory

That qmd file is the new blog post and when you render that, the blog home page will automatically update to include the newest post at the top of the listing.

Then just do `quarto preview`.


## How to update css

The easiest way is to open the website in Chrome and look inspect the page.
Then when you find exactly the class you want to update, you just update the scss file

For example, I wanted the TOC title in blue:
I have added
```css
h2#toc-title {
  color:$blue;
}
```
